  description: "I’m Muhammed R, and I have a real passion for all things tech. I love getting my hands dirty with both software and hardware projects, especially when it comes to robotics. Creating apps with Flutter is another area I enjoy, as it lets me craft great user experiences. Right now, I’m diving into a cool project where I’m customizing and building my own Android OS. It’s a fun challenge that really lets me explore new technologies and see what I can create.",
